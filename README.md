# 👋 Hello, I'm Amy 

## 👩🏻‍🦳 Who am I?

- I was born in Belfast, but live in Boston.
- I love brutalist architecture. I mean, I don't know what much about it, but looking at it gives me a sense of calm.
- I think the 80s were the best decade for music, but my favourite genres are pop-punk and EDM.
- I have a cat named Gillian Anderson.
- I really like lists.

## 💻 What do I do?

I explain the gap between (wo)man and machine. Or, more simply, I write docs.

## 🗻 The current hill I am willing to die on

Data is singular. No-one uses "datum" anymore, dork.
